# Project give me the odds #

- This project is using the MERN Stack to implement the solutions.
- The project is separated into 3 subfolders: 
    - cli (command line interface running the algorithm)
    - client (React.js front-end)
    - server (Node.js/express.js back-end)

# CLI #

- The CLI should be used as follow : 
    ## File inputs ##
    - Templates can be found in the 'data' folder
        - empire.json
        - millenium-falcon.json
    - Give relativ paths to the files you want to execute the algorithm with

    ## Algorithm ##
    - This is a recursive algorithm implementing the DFS logic with stop conditions
